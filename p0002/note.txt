map 
  template class map
  template ----- K, T, C, A
  orderness: strict weak ordering
  sorted -> compare fn
  unique key -> compare fn
  iterator
    iterates in ascending order of keys -> compare fn
    BidirectionalIterator, ConstexprIterator(26)

std::pair<const Key, T>
  pair type is used to combine possibily different two types

std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator

map is generally slower that unordered_map
to access individual elements by their key
but it allows the direction iteration on subsets based on thier orders

element access
  checked access: at
  access or insert: []

lookup
  count: 0 or 1
  find
  contains

non-member function
  ==
  <=> (20)
  !=, <, >, <=, >= (removed in 20)
